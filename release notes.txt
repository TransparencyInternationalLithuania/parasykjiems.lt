Version 0.5.1
Update of datatabaseRequired

* Added comment field for InstitutionTerritory. 
This allows to trace back the institution territory to source files. Simplifies debugging and tracing back where the information came from
* Street address is recognized ignoring case. Previously streets such as "gedimino G. Vilnius" would not be parsed correctly

* Did not correctly handle streets where there were more than 3 words. For example "Apolinaro Juozo Povilaiƒçio g. 1, Vilnius"

* Improved street range handling with letters. Previously, if a street range would be from 1 to 11, and user would query for "7B" (note the letter), the user query would not match this range. Now it does.

* Improved address database data.
